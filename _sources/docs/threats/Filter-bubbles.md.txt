# Filter bubbles

Google uses prior behaviour to change the search results they present us, how does this not use the same techniques as [cloaking](../attack-vectors/Cloaking.md)?

> _Google tries very hard to please you by finding you more stuff just like the other stuff you clicked on last time. That is the essence of Google’s great cleverness. But that very brilliance is becoming more and more damaging to the shared view out to an objective fact-based world … We are now all living in what we believe to be the objective, self-evidently google-able truth. And we are not._

The [impact of filter bubbles is highly contested (in bubbles)](../impacts/Filter-bubbles.md).
