# Blog networks

Private blog networks are a form of link farm. Its blogs are created for commercial promotion and the passage of link authority to target sites and are sometimes called splogs. They are often written using spinning software or are very poorly written. Owners of splogs often use expired domains or auction domains that have backlinks from high-authority websites.

## Known mitigations

* Google has been targeting and penalising splogs and private blog networks with several massive de-indexing campaigns since 2014 ([Google Targets Sites Using Private Blog Networks With Manual Action Ranking Penalties, Search Engine Land, 2014](https://searchengineland.com/google-targets-sites-using-private-blog-networks-manual-action-ranking-penalties-204000)).
