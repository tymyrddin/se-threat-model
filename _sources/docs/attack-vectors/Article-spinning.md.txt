# Article spinning

In article spinning, existing articles are rewritten by hired writers or automated using a thesaurus database or a neural network.

* Automatic rewriting: Word-for-word combinations are stored in either a text file or database thesaurus to draw from. This ensures that a large percentage of words are different from the original article. If done poorly the result is unidiomatic phrasing that is easy to detect.
* Spintax (spin syntax) uses a marked-up version of text to indicate which parts of the text are to be altered or rearranged. It can be extremely rich and complex, with nested spinning. The software uses tree structures and chooses possible paths in the tree giving variations of the original article without significantly changes its meaning. It is much harder to detect.
* Object and site owners can pay others to perform high quality spinning manually.

## Mitigation

* The major search engines do not detect article spinning as duplicate content.
