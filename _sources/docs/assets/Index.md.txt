# Index

If a search engine performs an indexing routine against private documents, but does not sufficiently verify that the actors who can access the index also have the privileges to access the private documents, and the results are available to outsiders who do not have access to those documents, then outsiders might be able to [obtain sensitive information](../threats/Information-exposure.md) by conducting targeted searches.
