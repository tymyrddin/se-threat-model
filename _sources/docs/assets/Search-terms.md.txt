Search terms to web search engines contain [significant amounts of sensitive information](../threats/Information-exposure.md) and, as such, the aggregation and use of these terms constitutes a privacy breach. Attackers steal keys, execute man-in-the-middle attacks, or steal clear text data off the server, while in transit, or from the userâ€™s client (browser).
